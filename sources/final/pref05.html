<h2 id="title-ID0ES5MM" class="docPrefaceTitle">A Brief History of
Qt</h2>

<p class="docText"><a name="The Qt"></a>The Qt framework first
became publicly available in May 1995. It was initially developed
by Haavard Nord (Trolltech's CEO) and Eirik Chambe-Eng (Trolltech's
Chief Troll). Haavard and Eirik met at the Norwegian Institute of
Technology in Trondheim, where they both graduated with master's
degrees in computer science.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="GUI development"></a>Haavard's interest
in C++ GUI development began in 1988 when he was commissioned by a
Swedish company to develop a C++ GUI framework. A couple of years
later, in the summer of 1990, Haavard and Eirik were working
together on a C++ database application for ultrasound images. The
system needed to be able to run with a GUI on Unix, Macintosh, and
Windows. One day that summer, Haavard and Eirik went outside to
enjoy the sunshine, and as they sat on a park bench, Haavard said,
"We need an object-oriented display system". The resulting
discussion laid the intellectual foundation for the object-oriented
cross-platform GUI framework they would soon go on to build.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="Haavard started"></a>In 1991, Haavard
started writing the classes that eventually became Qt,
collaborating with Eirik on the design. The following year, Eirik
came up with the idea for "signals and slots", a simple but
powerful GUI programming paradigm that has now been embraced by
several other toolkits. Haavard took the idea and produced a
hand-coded implementation. By 1993, Haavard and Eirik had developed
Qt's first graphics kernel and were able to implement their own
widgets. At the end of the year, Haavard suggested that they go
into business together to build "the world's best C++ GUI
framework".</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="wanting to"></a>The year 1994 began
inauspiciously with the two young programmers wanting to enter a
well-established market, with no customers, an unfinished product,
and no money. Fortunately, their wives were employed and therefore
able to support their husbands for the two years Eirik and Haavard
expected to need to develop the product and start earning an
income.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="the class"></a>The letter 'Q' was
chosen as the class prefix because the letter looked beautiful in
Haavard's Emacs font. The 't' was added to stand for "toolkit",
inspired by Xt, the X Toolkit. The company was incorporated on
March 4, 1994, originally as Quasar Technologies, then as Troll
Tech, and today as Trolltech.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="of Haavard"></a>In April 1995, thanks
to a contact made through one of Haavard's university professors,
the Norwegian company Metis gave them a contract to develop
software based on Qt. Around this time, Trolltech hired Arnt
Gulbrandsen, who during his six years at Trolltech devised and
implemented an ingenious documentation system as well as
contributing to Qt's code.</p>

<p class="docText">On May 20, 1995, Qt 0.90 was uploaded to
<tt>sunsite.unc.edu</tt><a name="on"></a>. Six days later, the
release was announced on <tt>comp.os.linux.announce</tt><a name=
"for both"></a>. This was Qt's first public release. Qt could be
used for both Windows and Unix development, offering the same API
on both platforms. Qt was available under two licenses from day
one: A commercial license was required for commercial development,
and a free software edition was available for open source
development. The Metis contract kept Trolltech afloat, while for
ten long months no one bought a commercial Qt license.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="March"></a>In March 1996, the European
Space Agency became the second Qt customer, with a purchase of ten
commercial licenses. With unwavering faith, Eirik and Haavard hired
another developer. Qt 0.97 was released at the end of May, and on
September 24, 1996, Qt 1.0 came out. By the end of the year, Qt had
reached version 1.1; eight customers, each in a different country,
had bought 18 licenses between them. This year also saw the
founding of the KDE project, led by Matthias Ettrich.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="to build"></a>Qt 1.2 was released in
April 1997. Matthias Ettrich's decision to use Qt to build KDE
helped Qt become the de facto standard for C++ GUI development on
Linux. Qt 1.3 was released in September 1997.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="Matthias joined"></a>Matthias joined
Trolltech in 1998, and the last major Qt 1 release, 1.40, was made
in September of that year. Qt 2.0 was released in June 1999. Qt 2
had a new open source license, the Q Public License (QPL), which
complied with the Open Source Definition. In August 1999, Qt won
the LinuxWorld award for best library/tool. Around this time,
Trolltech Pty Ltd (Australia) was established.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="Linux in"></a>Trolltech released
Qt/Embedded Linux in 2000. It was designed to run on embedded Linux
devices and provided its own window system as a lightweight
replacement for X11. Both Qt/X11 and Qt/Embedded Linux were now
offered under the widely used GNU General Public License (GPL) as
well as under commercial licenses. By the end of 2000, Trolltech
had established Trolltech Inc. (USA) and had released the first
version of Qtopia, an application platform for mobile phones and
PDAs. Qt/Embedded Linux won the LinuxWorld "Best Embedded Linux
Solution" award in both 2001 and 2002, and Qtopia Phone achieved
the same distinction in 2004.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="was released"></a>Qt 3.0 was released
in 2001. Qt was now available on Windows, Mac OS X, Unix, and Linux
(desktop and embedded). Qt 3 provided 42 new classes and its code
exceeded 500000 lines. Qt 3 was a major step forward from Qt 2,
including considerably improved locale and Unicode support, a
completely new text viewing and editing widget, and a Perl-like
regular expression class. Qt 3 won the Software Development Times
"Jolt Productivity Award" in 2002.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="and more"></a>In the summer of 2005, Qt
4.0 was released. With about 500 classes and more than 9000
functions, Qt 4 is larger and richer than any previous version, and
it has been split into several libraries so that developers only
need to link against the parts of Qt that they need. Qt 4 is a huge
advance on previous versions with improvements that include a
completely new set of efficient and easy-to-use template
containers, advanced model/view functionality, a fast and flexible
2D painting framework, and powerful Unicode text viewing and
editing classes, not to mention thousands of smaller enhancements
across the complete range of Qt classes. Qt 4's feature set is now
so broad that it has taken Qt beyond being a GUI toolkit and made
it into a full-blown application development framework. Qt 4 is
also the first Qt edition to be available for both commercial and
open source development on all the platforms it supports.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="representative office"></a>Also in
2005, Trolltech opened a representative office in Beijing to
provide customers in China and the region with sales services,
training, and technical support for Qt/Embedded Linux and
Qtopia.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="availability of"></a>Qt has long been
available to non-C++ programmers through the availability of
unofficial language bindings, in particular PyQt for Python
programmers. In 2007, the Qyoto unofficial bindings were released
for C# programmers. Also in 2007, Trolltech launched Qt Jambi, an
officially supported Java version of the Qt API. <a class="docLink"
href="app03.html#app03">Appendix C</a> provides an introduction to
Qt Jambi.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="continues to"></a>Since Trolltech's
birth, Qt's popularity has grown unabated and continues to grow to
this day. This success is a reflection both of the quality of Qt
and of how enjoyable it is to use. In the past decade, Qt has gone
from being a product used by a select few "in the know" to one that
is used daily by thousands of customers and tens of thousands of
open source developers all around the world.</p>
