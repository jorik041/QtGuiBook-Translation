Acknowledgments</h2>

<p class="docText"><a name="Our first"></a>Our first acknowledgment
is of Eirik Chambe-Eng, Trolltech's Chief Troll and one of
Trolltech's two founders. Eirik not only enthusiastically
encouraged us to write the Qt 3 edition of the book, he also
allowed us to spend a considerable amount of our work time writing
it. Eirik and Trolltech CEO Haavard Nord both read the manuscript
and provided valuable feedback. Their generosity and foresight were
aided and abetted by Matthias Ettrich, who cheerfully accepted our
neglect of duty as we obsessed over the writing of this book, and
gave us a lot of advice on good Qt programming style.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="Qt"></a>For the Qt 3 edition, we asked
two Qt customers, Paul Curtis and Klaus Schmidinger, to be our
external reviewers. Both are Qt experts with an amazing attention
to technical detail, which they proved by spotting some very subtle
errors in our manuscript and suggesting numerous improvements. And
within Trolltech, alongside Matthias, our most stalwart reviewer
was Reginald Stadlbauer. His technical insight was invaluable, and
he taught us how to do some things in Qt that we didn't even know
were possible.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="this Qt"></a>For this Qt 4 edition, we
have continued to benefit from the unstinting help and support of
Eirik, Haavard, and Matthias. Klaus Schmidinger continued to give
valuable feedback, and we also benefitted from Qt customer Paul
Floyd's careful reviewing of some of the new material. Thanks also
to David García Garzón for help on SCons in <a class="docLink"
href="app02.html#app02">Appendix B</a><a name=
"Aardal Hanssen"></a>. Within Trolltech, our key reviewers were
Carlos Manuel Duclos Vergara, Andreas Aardal Hanssen, Henrik Hartz,
Martin Jones, Vivi Glückstad Karlsen, Trond Kjernåsen, Trenton
Schulz, Andy Shaw, Gunnar Sletta, and Pål de Vibe.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="mentioned above"></a>In addition to the
reviewers mentioned above, we received expert help from Eskil
Abrahamsen Blomfeldt (Qt Jambi), Frans Englich (XML), Harald
Fernengel (databases), Kent Hansen (application scripting), Volker
Hilsheimer (ActiveX), Bradley Hughes (multithreading), Lars Knoll
(2D graphics and internationalization), Anders Larsen (databases),
Sam Magnuson (<tt>qmake</tt><a name="Rainer Schmid"></a>), Marius
Bugge Monsen (item view classes), Dimitri Papadopoulos (Qt/X11),
Girish Ramakrishnan (style sheets), Samuel Rødal (3D graphics),
Rainer Schmid (networking and XML), Amrit Pal Singh (introduction
to C++), Paul Olav Tvete (custom widgets and embedded programming),
Geir Vattekar (Qt Jambi), and Thomas Zander (build systems).</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="and support"></a>Extra thanks are due
to Trolltech's documentation and support teams for handling
documentation-related issues while the book consumed so much of our
time, and to Trolltech's system administrators for keeping our
machines running and our networks communicating throughout the
project.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="typesetting tool"></a>On the production
side, Jeff Kingston, author of the Lout typesetting tool, continued
to add enhancements to the tool, many in response to our feedback.
Also thanks to James Cloos for providing a condensed version of the
DejaVu Mono font that we used as the basis for our monospaced font.
Trolltech's Cathrine Bore handled the contracts and legalities on
our behalf. Thanks also to Nathan Clement for the troll
illustrations, and to Audrey Doyle for her careful proofreading.
And finally, thanks to our editor, Debra Williams-Cauley, both for
her support and for making the process as hassle-free as possible,
and to Lara Wysong for handling the production practicalities so
well.</p>
