<h2 id="title-ID0EA5MM" class="docPrefaceTitle">Preface</h2>

<p class="docText"><a name="Qt is"></a>Qt is a comprehensive C++
application development framework for creating cross-platform GUI
applications using a "write once, compile anywhere" approach. Qt
lets programmers use a single source tree for applications that
will run on Windows 98 to Vista, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX,
and many other versions of Unix with X11. The Qt libraries and
tools are also part of Qt/Embedded Linux, a product that provides
its own window system on top of embedded Linux.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="of this"></a>The purpose of this book
is to teach you how to write GUI programs using Qt 4. The book
starts with "Hello Qt" and quickly progresses to more advanced
topics, such as creating custom widgets and providing drag and
drop. The text is complemented by a set of examples that you can
download from the book's web site, <a class="docLink" target=
"_blank" href=
"http://www.informit.com/title/0132354160">http://www.informit.com/title/0132354160</a>.
<a class="docLink" href="app01.html#app01">Appendix A</a><a name=
"how to"></a> explains how to download and install the software,
including a free C++ compiler for those using Windows.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="all the"></a>The book is divided into
three parts. Part I covers all the fundamental concepts and
practices necessary for programming GUI applications using Qt.
Knowledge of this part alone is sufficient to write useful GUI
applications. Part II covers central Qt topics in greater depth,
and Part III provides more specialized and advanced material. You
can read the chapters of Parts II and III in any order, but they
assume familiarity with the contents of Part I. The book also
includes several appendixes, with <a class="docLink" href=
"app02.html#app02">Appendix B</a><a name="applications and"></a>
showing how to build Qt applications and <a class="docLink" href=
"app03.html#app03">Appendix C</a> introducing Qt Jambi, the Java
version of Qt.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="the Qt"></a>The first Qt 4 edition of
the book built on the Qt 3 edition, although it was completely
revised to reflect good idiomatic Qt 4 programming techniques and
included new chapters on Qt 4's model/view architecture, the new
plugin framework, embedded programming with Qt/Embedded Linux, and
a new appendix. This extended and revised second edition has been
thoroughly updated to take advantage of features introduced in Qt
versions 4.2 and 4.3, and includes new chapters on look and feel
customization and application scripting as well as two new
appendixes. The original graphics chapter has been split into
separate 2D and 3D chapters, which between them now cover the new
graphics view classes and <tt>QPainter</tt><a name=
"been added"></a>'s OpenGL back-end. In addition, much new material
has been added to the database, XML, and embedded programming
chapters.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="providing realistic"></a>This edition,
like its predecessors, emphasizes explaining Qt programming and
providing realistic examples, rather than simply rehashing or
summarizing Qt's extensive online documentation. Because the book
teaches solid Qt 4 programming principles and practices, readers
will easily be able to learn the new Qt modules that come out in Qt
4.4, Qt 4.5, and later Qt 4.<span class=
"docEmphasis">x</span><a name="you are"></a> versions. If you are
using one of these later versions, be sure to read the "What's New
in Qt 4.<span class="docEmphasis">x</span><a name="the new"></a>"
documents in the reference documentation to get an overview of the
new features that are available.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="We have"></a>We have written the book
with the assumption that you have a basic knowledge of C++, Java,
or C#. The code examples use a subset of C++, avoiding many C++
features that are rarely needed when programming Qt. In the few
places where a more advanced C++ construct is unavoidable, it is
explained as it is used. If you already know Java or C# but have
little or no experience with C++, we recommend that you begin by
reading <a class="docLink" href="app04.html#app04">Appendix
D</a><a name="sufficient introduction"></a>, which provides
sufficient introduction to C++ to be able to use this book. For a
more thorough introduction to object-oriented programming in C++,
we recommend <span class="docEmphasis"><a name="to Program"></a>C++
How to Program</span> by P. J. Deitel and H. M. Deitel (Prentice
Hall, 2007), and <span class="docEmphasis">C++ Primer</span> by
Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo
(Addison-Wesley, 2005).</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="its intuitive"></a>Qt made its
reputation as a cross-platform framework, but thanks to its
intuitive and powerful API, many organizations use Qt for
single-platform development. Adobe Photoshop Album is just one
example of a mass-market Windows application written in Qt. Many
sophisticated software systems in vertical markets, such as 3D
animation tools, digital film processing, electronic design
automation (for chip design), oil and gas exploration, financial
services, and medical imaging, are built with Qt. If you are making
a living with a successful Windows product written in Qt, you can
easily create new markets in the Mac OS X and Linux worlds simply
by recompiling.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="If you"></a>Qt is available under
various licenses. If you want to build commercial applications, you
must buy a commercial Qt license from Trolltech; if you want to
build open source programs, you can use the open source (GPL)
edition. The K Desktop Environment (KDE) and most of the open
source applications that go with it are built on Qt.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="scope and"></a>In addition to Qt's
hundreds of classes, there are add-ons that extend Qt's scope and
power. Some of these products, like the Qt Solutions components,
are available from Trolltech, while others are supplied by other
companies and by the open source community; see <a class="docLink"
target="_blank" href=
"http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/3rdparty/">http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/3rdparty/</a><a name="also have"></a>
for a list of available add-ons. Trolltech's developers also have
their own web site, Trolltech Labs (<a class="docLink" target=
"_blank" href=
"http://labs.trolltech.com/">http://labs.trolltech.com/</a><a name=
"written because"></a>), where they put unofficial code that they
have written because it is fun, interesting, or useful. Qt has a
well-established and thriving user community that uses the
<tt>qt-interest</tt><a name="see"></a> mailing list; see <a class=
"docLink" target="_blank" href=
"http://lists.trolltech.com/">http://lists.trolltech.com/</a> for
details.</p>

the book, have suggestions for the next edition, or want to give us
feedback, we would be delighted to hear from you. You can reach us
