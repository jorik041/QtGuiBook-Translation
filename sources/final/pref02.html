<p class="docText"><a name="Why Qt"></a>Why Qt? Why do programmers
like us choose Qt? Sure, there are the obvious answers: Qt's
single-source compatibility, its feature richness, its C++
performance, the availability of the source code, its
documentation, the high-quality technical support, and all the
other items mentioned in Trolltech's glossy marketing materials.
This is all very well, but it misses the most important point: Qt
is successful because programmers <span class=
"docEmphasis">like</span> it.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="programmers like"></a>How come
programmers like one technology, but dislike another? Personally, I
believe software engineers enjoy technology that feels right, but
dislike everything that doesn't. How else can we explain that some
of the brightest programmers need help to program a video recorder,
or that most engineers seem to have trouble operating the company's
phone system? I for one am perfectly capable of memorizing
sequences of random numbers and commands, but if these are required
to control my answering machine, I'd prefer not to have one. At
Trolltech, our phone system forces us to press the '*' for two
seconds before we are allowed to enter the other person's extension
number. If you forget to do this and start to enter the extension
immediately, you have to dial the entire number again. Why '*'? Why
not '#', or '1', or '5', or any of the other 20 keys on the phone?
Why two seconds and not one, or three, or one and a half? Why
anything at all? I find the phone so irritating that I avoid using
it whenever I can. Nobody likes having to do random things,
especially when those random things apparently depend on some
equally random context you wish you didn't have to know about in
the first place.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="can be"></a>Programming can be a lot
like using our phone system, only worse. And this is where Qt comes
to the rescue. Qt is different. For one thing, Qt makes sense. And
for another, Qt is fun. Qt lets you concentrate on your tasks. When
Qt's original architects faced a problem, they didn't just look for
a good solution, or a quick solution, or the simplest solution.
They looked for the <span class="docEmphasis">right</span><a name=
"their design"></a> solution, and then they documented it. Granted,
they made mistakes, and granted, some of their design decisions
didn't pass the test of time, but they still got a lot of things
right, and what wasn't right could and can be corrected. You can
see this by the fact that a system originally designed to bridge
Windows 95 and Unix/Motif now unifies modern desktop systems as
diverse as Windows Vista, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux, as well as small
devices such as mobile phones.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="popular and"></a>Long before Qt became
so popular and so widely used, the dedication of Qt's developers to
finding the right solutions made Qt special. That dedication is
just as strong today and affects everyone who maintains and
develops Qt. For us, working on Qt is a responsibility and a
privilege. We are proud of helping to make your professional and
open source lives easier and more enjoyable.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="to use"></a>One of the things that
makes Qt a pleasure to use is its online documentation. But the
documentation's focus is primarily on individual classes, with
little said about how to build sophisticated real-world
applications. This excellent book fills that gap. It shows you what
Qt has to offer, how to program Qt the "Qt way", and how to get the
best from Qt. The book will teach a C++, Java, or C# programmer how
to program Qt, and provides enough advanced material to satisfy
experienced Qt programmers. The book is packed with good examples,
advice, and explanationsâ€”and it is the text that we use to induct
all new programmers who join Trolltech.</p>

<p class="docText"><a name="free Qt"></a>Nowadays, a vast number of
commercial and free Qt applications are available for purchase or
download. Some are specialized for particular vertical markets,
while others are aimed at the mass-market. Seeing so many
applications built with Qt fills us with pride and inspires us to
make Qt even better. And with the help of this book, there will be
more and higher-quality Qt applications than ever before.</p>
